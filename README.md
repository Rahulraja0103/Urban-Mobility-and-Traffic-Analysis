# Urban-Mobility-and-Traffic-Analysis

The aim of our project is to analyze traffic and urban mobility patterns in any specific city or place. The output which we are expecting from this project has the potential which can significantly improve the transportation system, minimize any traffic congestions in that area, and enhance the overall standard of living. For this we need at least of two different publicly accessible data sources, that are constantly updated with various kinds of data that will be required to be used for the purpose of this project.
Real-time data regarding vehicle counts, the flow of traffic, and congestion can be easily obtained through these various sources. Data on bus and subway routes, schedules, and the number of riders is frequently made accessible by public transportation agencies

Based on the Datasets we create different Visualization to show the Urban Traffic and we can analyze what measures can be taken after looking at the results.
